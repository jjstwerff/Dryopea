The short term, high priority list.
The highest priority item is normally repairing the currently defined tests.
Secondary is always the warning free generation of code in clippy.

Link to feature documents when possible. It is allowed to indicate that only a part of the feature is high priority.
Eventually features need to be "done" however that is never a short term goal.
